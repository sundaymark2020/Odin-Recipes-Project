    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Slice the water leaves and fluted pumpkin leaves with a kitchen knife,
        you want them thinly sliced as you can see below.
      </li>

      <li>
        Wash the roasted fish, remove center bone and break to smaller bits.
      </li>

      <li>
        Season the goat meat with a teaspoon of salt, sliced onions and two
        seasoning cubes. Allow the meat to boil, add two cups of water and let
        the meat cook until it becomes tender and easy to chew.
      </li>

      <li>
        To the boiling meat, add the washed, roasted fish. Allow them to cook
        until the water dries. Don’t allow it to burn.Most people don’t like too
        much water in their vegetable soup, to achieve that, use some tricks –
        like boiling the meat/fish till the water is almost dried.
      </li>

      <li>
        When the meat cooked and the water is almost completely dried, add the
        palm oil, 400ml. You need lots of palm oil when you cook vegetable soup.
      </li>

      <li>
        Now you add the vegetables, the water leaves should come first. It
        should fill the pot, it will go down in 3 minutes as you continue to
        stir.
