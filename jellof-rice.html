    <h1>JELLOF RICE</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Rice dishes are very common in most West-African cultures and the Nigerian 
        jollof rice is one of many great variations. Jollof rice itself is popular 
        in countries such as Ghana, Nigeria, and Senegal. Like I said in my food in 
        theory article Nigerian Jollof 101 â€“ Extras & Essentials, 
        the debate on which country makes the best Jollof is one that could go on 
        forever.
         As a Nigerian, I can say that aside from the taste and flavour, a beautiful 
         thing about the Nigerian Jollof rice dish is how it varies. From the classic
          Jollof to party
         style Jollof and a recent favourite that is basmati Jollof and more.
